//! OpenScreen Network Protocol
//!
//! This crate implements the OpenScreen Network Protocol, which handles
//! authentication between devices using SPAKE2 password-authenticated key exchange.
//!
//! The Network Protocol is the first layer in the OpenScreen protocol suite,
//! establishing a secure authenticated channel before any application-level
//! messages (presentations, agent info) can be exchanged.
